  - Hosting solution / hooking up to data.worthrises.org
- Styling
  - See mock-up (+comments) for styling guidance - Bianca and Luke will send by Friday
  - Where are we with mobile design?
  - Can we change the color of the loading box to light purple?
  - ~~When you hover over column names, a pop-up appears that says “Toggle SortBy” – do
we have access to editing that? Maybe just “Sort by”?~~
  - Remove horizontal scroll bar on drop down menus in filters
  - Make font size and style in filter box match that of the data – both headers and data
  - After deletion of other columns, extend Corporation column a bit to avoid as much
wrapping
- Main database screen - filter box
  - Nothing is showing up when you select two different sectors
  - Have we addressed the export formatting?
  - Sector names should show up in the box when you select it
  - When you filter for sector and subsectors, we need to pull all corporations that list those
as either primary or other. It currently looks like it’s pulling only if it’s listed as primary
- Main database screen - data box
  - Linking parents
  - Did we address the invalid stock tickers for corps trading on an international market?
Will need to reflect in corporate profile as well
- Corporate profiles
  - In the Sources section, when it says “Correction: See website,” would it be possible for
“website” to hyperlink to the corporate website?
  - Can you look into which corporations are listing on the database as “(brand not active)”?
I’m catching a bunch that are showing up as not active but definitely should be (ex: Geo
Group)
  - What does the corporate profile look like when there’s no stock ticker? Did we address
that?
- Airtable
  - The following subsectors need to be 1 single tag in the “other subsectors” column (looks
like they got broken up by the commas):
■ Arrest, Court, and Probation Data
■ Procurement and Contracting
■ Furnishing, Supplies, and Other Facility Equipment
■ Education Services and Materials
■ Probation, Parole, and Other Supervision
■ Construction and Equipment
